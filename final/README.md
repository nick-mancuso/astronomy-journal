# FINAL REPORT

## HR Diagram

![](hr-plot-labeled.png)

> Explain in a few sentences what each part is.

 - Giant Branch
   - Consists of red giant and supergiant stars. These stars have a lower surface temperature and high luminosity compared to main sequence stars. Stars found in this area include Anteres and Betelguese. These stars are near the end of their lives.
 - Main Sequence
   - This is the area where stars spend the majority of their young lives. It includes stars like our sun, Sirius, and Regulus.
 - White Dwarfs
   - This is where smaller and medium sized stars end up at the end of their lives. White Dwarf stars are hot, with low luminosity.

> What are some differences you see between your plot and the plot in this article?

Some differences between my plot and the article include:
 - Our data is cut off at bp-rp = 3.
 - Our plot doesn't show lower absolute magnitudes.
 - Our plot appears to have more stars between the main sequence and White Drawf areas.
 - The "unstable" area includes more stars in our plot.

> How do you think these differences are explained?

The article's plot is from the second release, so is a bit older than our data.
Additionally, Gaia's plot uses data from nearly four times as many stars. Our
query can also explain some of the differences; we are only considering closer,
bluer stars.
