## Image Name: m31.fits

### Statistics

Minimum: 900.42
Maximum: 20246.8

The minimum and maximum values show what the image has a wide range of pixel values,
meaning that we have stars and other elements that range from very dim to very bright. The
brightest element in this image is the center of M31. By the descriptions in the lab, this
image would not be considered "flat" or "oversaturated".

Mean: 1435.767
Std Dev: 195.7611

I think that my image has an small standard deviation, considering the range of values that were
recorded.

#### Pixel Values

Object | Xc, Yc | FWHM | Peak Pixel Value | Star-Sky | Sky | Width | Elongation
-------|--------|------|------------------|----------|-----|-------|-----------
Star 1 | 30, 690 | 5.03 | 13665.32 | 358870 | 1350.156 | 9 | 0.073 (round)
Star 2 | 368, 622 | 4.72 | 1848.005 | 11402.91 | 1400.667 | 5 | 0.318 (not very round)

Outlying stars are more elongated due to the curvature of the mirror in the telescope. Brighter
stars appear "larger" in our image, but really, these stars are likely smaller than the dimmer
stars. The "sky" value for both stars is similar; this is what it should be.

#### Ratio of (star-sky) / sky

Star 1: 265.8
Star 2: 8.1

### Histogram

#### Composite Image

Pixel value at highest peak: 1373.83
Number of pixels with this value: 5773

These pixels represent the dark sky.

There are no saturated stars in this image.

This histogram indicates that the image is uniform and well calibrated.

#### Raw Image

Pixel value at hight peak: 2749.11
Number of pixels with this value: 84775

There are no saturated stars in this image.

This histogram shows a lot of noise (in the form of light where there are no objects).


### Master Bias Frame

The bias frame shows noise generated by the CCD itself.

I would expect the histogram of the master bias frame to show a fairly even distribution of
pixel values.

My observation of the master bias frame is somewhat consistent with my expectation; there are
two bell shaped curves for the "Black and White" min and max, but upon viewing the 0.0 - 65535
range, all of the pixels fall into a very small range of pixel values.

### Master Dark Frame

The dark frame shows noise in the form of heat from the operation of the CCD.

I would expect the histogram of the master dark frame to show a small range of pixel
values.

My observation of the master dark frame was inconsistent with my prediction; the pixel
values are more dispersed than I had expected, and more distrbuted than the master bias
fram was. The pixel values were mostly higher than the master bias frame, which I did expect.

### Master Flat Frame

The flat frame shows dust spots and irregularities in the telescope. It is produced by placing a
white board in front of the CCD.

I would expect the histogram to have a large number of high pixel values in the "white" area.

My observation of the histogram was consistent with my expectation.

## Profiling Calibrated Image

### Slice 1
The only star in this slice appears as a narrow peak.
I do not see any detailed structure in this slice.

### Slice 2
There are no star peaks in this slice.
There is a detailed structure from M31.
The structure appears to have an asymptotic, 1/(x^2) appearance in the middle of the slice. This
peak corresponds to the center of M31.

### Slice 3
There are some very small peaks (wider, v-shaped in appearance). I assume that these may be distant
galaxies.

### Slice 4
The only star in this slice appears as a very narrow high peak.
As opposed to slice 1, there is consistent but small increase before the star's peak, and a slow
but steady decrease after it.

### Slice 5
This slice has no visible stars in it, but there is a bit of structure in the left half of the
slice. There may be some very distant galaxies or star clusters in this area.

## Measuring Distance in Calibrated Image

Star 1: (294.386, 531.212)

Object | Dist. Pixels | Dist. Microns | Dist Arcsec | PA
-------|--------------|---------------|-------------|----
(334.164, 569, 127) | 54.953 | 0.495 | 24.289 | 226.374
