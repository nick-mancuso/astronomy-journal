4. Which cluster is the oldest? How old?

    The M67 cluster is the oldest at 3.6 billion years. The next closest in age was NGC 
    752 at 2 billion years old.
    
5. Which cluster is the youngest? How young?

    The IC 4665 cluster is the youngest of all the clusters we studied, at 63 million
    years. In fact, I could have further adjusted the log(age/yr) slider to get a better
    fit, but it seemed to be at it's lowest setting.
    
6. How do the ages of these star clusters compare with the age of the galaxy 
      (or the age of the universe)? Comment on any differences.
      
      All of the start clusters are of much lesser age then the Milky Way, which
      is estimated to be 13.51 billion years old. This makes sense because the
      Milky Way would have to begin forming before the clusters that it contains.
      
      The age of the universe is estimated to be 13.8 billion years old, which means
      that many galaxies were formed early on in the life of the universe. All of the
      clusters that we studied are much closer in age to our planet (4.5 billion years)
      than to the age of our galaxy or universe.
      
      I was suprised to find out that there was such a variance in age between the stars
      in our galaxy; I had falsely assumed that they would have formed around the same time
      as each other AND the galaxy.
      
  7. Which cluster is the most distant, and which is the closest? Comment
      on where these clusters tell us about the extent of the Milky Way
      galaxy.
      
      The cluster that was the furthest away is M67 at 692 parsecs. The HR diagram
      for this cluster was very different compared to others; the stars were grouped
      tightly at the bottom of the graph. This is because of the distance and age of
      this cluster. The closest cluster was The Hyades cluster at 40 parsecs. This
      cluster's diagram was also fairly unique, in that it had a very even distribution
      across the graph and was probably the cluster with the most stars in it's diagram.
      
      What the differences in the distance of these clusters tell me about the Milky Way
      is that, to me, it is unimaginably gigantic. One parsec is just an abstract idea as
      a thousand parsecs are; and the Milky Way galaxy is over 16,000 parsecs in diameter.
      Another observation that I made in this lab is that the clusters that are the furthest
      away are the oldest; from this fact I can draw the conslusion that it is likely that
      we (Earth) are closer to the center of the galaxy, which would also be the youngest
      part of the Milky Way. This implies that the galaxy "spreads" over time, expanding
      as it ages.
